# mitoTree Visualization

**mitoTree** is a web-based tool designed to visualize and explore human mitochondrial DNA phylogenetic trees. It provides a way to browse haplogroups, view hierarchical tree structures, and examine detailed node information for individual mitochondrial mutations.
It gathers data from Genbank, builds a phylogenetic tree and plots it data using d3.js.

## WebApp

### Features
- **Explore mitoTree**: Interactive phylogenetic tree visualization, including radial and collapsible views.
- **Haplogroup Search**: Search for Haplogroups by ID or by HG signature.
- **Node Details**: Detailed view of HG information, including HG signatures, ancestors, descendants and profiles.
- **Downloads**: Different tree data files as well as visualizations available to download.

### Usage

## Development

### Project Structure

The web-app is in the directory 'docs/'.
'utils/' and other python files are the current tree creating pipeline.
Exact pipeline from end to end is still coming.
