# About the mitoTree project

The idea of mitoTree is to create an up-to-date and interactive phylogenetic tree of human mitochondrial DNA
based on quality-controlled full mitochondrial DNA sequences. Gathering already generated data and utilizing
them in a modern, handy implementation is the next step in data modernization and harmonization. This update
of the human phylogeny allows for improved haplogrouping and prevents the unregulated development of
self-introduced haplogroups. Additionally, the improved knowledge of the human mtDNA phylogeny is applicable
in various scientific disciplines and will push a variety of current research areas.
